```swift
let view = UIView()
let viewController = UIViewContoller()
```
This is a basic init code.<br>
but... if you make Xib, Storyboard.<br>
you should init different way.
<br>
```swift
let nib = UINib(nibName: "View", bundle: nil)
let view = nib.instantiate(withOwner: nil, options: nil)[0] as! UIView

let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
let viewContoller = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ViewContoller") as! ViewContoller
```
And then... this is the point.
even if you make view and viewContoller this way,<br>
calling IBOutlet properties may be return none.<br>
<br>
because, view and viewContoller hasn't loaded its view hierarchy yet. (like lazy properties)<br>
loads its view hierarchy only when something sends it a view message.<br>
So here your outlets are may nil since it is not loaded yet.<br>
<br>
just try to force your VC to call self.view and then access the properties/outlets.
