Explore to "\(Project directory)"/Pods/Target Support Files/"Pods-\(Project name)"<br/>
<br/>
Then, you can see some files like...<br/>
"Pods-\(Project name)".debug.xcconfig" / "Pods-\(Project name).release.xcconfig"<br/>
<br/>
Define frameworks each platform you want to use, reference below code.<br/>
<br/>

```swift
// For iOS platform.
OTHER_LDFLAGS[sdk=iphone*] = $(inherited) -l"c++" -l"sqlite3" -l"z" -framework "SOME FRAMEWORK" ...

// For macOS platform.
OTHER_LDFLAGS = $(inherited) -l"c++" -l"sqlite3" -l"z" -framework "SOME FRAMEWORK" ...
```
