There are several things about control of orientation,<br>
and sometime you should have to rotate orientation you want to.<br>
<br>
This is the code, rotate device orientation programmatically.<br>
```swift
let orientation: UIInterfaceOrientation = .portrait // you want to...
UIDevice.current.setValue(orientation.rawValue, forKey: "orientation")
```
How about try some combine another orientation control code and this?
