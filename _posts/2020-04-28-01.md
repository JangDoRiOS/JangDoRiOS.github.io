```swift
VC.modalPresentationStyle = .overCurrentContext
VC.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
```
Presenting with ".overCurrentContext, .overFullScreen" and when it dismissed.<br>
Parent VC doesn't call viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear.<br>
<br>
```swift
VC.modalPresentationStyle = .currentContext
VC.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
```
However, presenting with ".currentContext, .fullScreen" and when it dismissed.<br>
Parent VC will call viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear.<br>
