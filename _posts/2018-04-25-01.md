You can make custom font to descriptor with matrix.
and this is my way for make italic font even if no has italic trait.
<br>
```swift
let angle = CGFloat(tanf(11 * Float.pi / 180))
let transform = CGAffineTransform(a: 1, b: 0, c: angle, d: 1, tx: 0, ty: 0)
let descriptor = UIFontDescriptor(name: "font name", matrix: transform)
let font = UIFont(descriptor: descriptor, size: "font size")
```
It will be useful to known how to using descriptor like this.
