Setting 'isChecked' is triggered toggle animation.<br />
<br />
So, it may acting weird not just you want to.<br />
Key point is "animation."<br />
<br />
At this time, "jumpDrawablesToCurrentState()" function might be help.<br />
it set button state without animation.

```kotlin
isChecked = value
jumpDrawablesToCurrentState()
```
