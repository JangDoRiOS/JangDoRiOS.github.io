1. Go to http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/<br />
<br />
2. Get a User Access Token with a permission "manage_pages"<br />
<br />
3. Convert this short-lived access token into a long-lived one by making this Graph API call:
   https://graph.facebook.com/v2.12/oauth/access_token?client_id=<your FB App ID >&client_secret=<your FB App secret>&grant_type=fb_exchange_token&fb_exchange_token=<your short-lived access token><br />
<br />
4. Make a call Graph API:
   https://graph.facebook.com/v2.12/<your personal account FB user id>/accounts?access_token=<your long-lived access token><br />
<br />
5. The returned access_token has no expiration unless you change your password or not more admin of the target page or deauthorize FB page<br />
<br />
