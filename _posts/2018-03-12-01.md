1. Go to http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/

2. Get a User Access Token with a permission "manage_pages"

3. Convert this short-lived access token into a long-lived one by making this Graph API call:
   https://graph.facebook.com/v2.12/oauth/access_token?client_id=(your FB App ID)&client_secret=(your FB App secret)&grant_type=fb_exchange_token&fb_exchange_token=(your short-lived access token)

4. Make a call Graph API:
   https://graph.facebook.com/v2.12/(your personal account FB user id)/accounts?access_token=(your long-lived access token)

5. The returned access_token has no expiration unless you change your password or not more admin of the target page or deauthorize FB page
