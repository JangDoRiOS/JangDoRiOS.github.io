When you develop iOS application, probably you saw `UIPageViewController (referred to as PageView)`.

`PageView` has basically `UIPageControl (referred to as controlView)` as it's subview.

If you tapping `ControlView` you can see `PageView` change it's childview(page) to next page.
<br/>
In my case, used this code to had to display `ControlView` indicator
```swift
view.bringSubview(toFront: UIPageControl)
```

then `ControlView` indicator displayed well
<br/>
But i didn't know **Tapping 'UIPageControl' occur paging effect to next page**
App isn't complex... so, i add below code simply to prevent in this situation.
```swift
UIPageControl.isUserInteractionEnabled = false
UIPageControl.isHidden = false
```

It's not bad for you to knowing this infomation in this time. :)
