Lazy Properties has attribute, allocate once when it called.
<br>
<br>
So we can make one time code with lazy Properties.
```swift
lazy var once: Void = {
    // Run code once
}()
```
Itâ€™s acting like this.
```swift
var ifFirst = false
if !isFirst {
    isFirst = true
    // Run code once
}
```
<br>
If you want read-only lazy Properties, here is the code.
```swift
private(set) lazy var once: Void = {
    // Run code once
}()
```
This property has basically internal scope but 'Set' is controlled like private.
