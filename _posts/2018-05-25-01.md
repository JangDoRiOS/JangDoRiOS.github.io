***1. Universal(fat) framework.<br>***
<br>
1) ***Build Settings -> Architectures -> Build Active Architecture Only<br>***
When if this option is **YES** Xcode makes build for your OS system only. (likes x86_64)<br>
if you want to compatible for i386 system either, set this option **NO**.<br>
<br>
2) ***Build Settings -> Deployment -> Installation Directory<br>***
I don't know precisely why we have to modify this option.<br>
but if didn't, you will get **framework cannot be loaded** error message from Xcode.<br>
this option have to set **@loader_path/Frameworks** or **@executable_path/Frameworks**.<br>
<br>
3) ***Build Settings -> Deployment -> Skip Install<br>***
Maybe you need to this option be changed. however, i suggest to **YES**.<br>
because if this option is **NO**, framework will be install with your main app<br>
and due to cause of dependency problem.<br>
<br>
4) ***Build Settings -> Linking -> Mach-O type<br>***
if your framework contain asset(likes strings, images etc...)<br>
you should **Dynamic Library. Static Library can't contain any asset.<br>**
<br>
5) ***Combine real device and simulator module.<br>***
Build your project twice for real device and simulator.<br>
navigate to **Xcode navigator -> your Project -> Products -> YOURFRAMEWORK.framework<br>**
and right mouse click, select **Show in Finder**<br>
<br>
open cmd and excute below line.<br>
<br>
**lipo -create -output FRAMEWORKNAME REALDEVICE-EXECUTABLE-PATH SIMULATOR-EXECUTABLE-PATH**<br>
<br>
EXECUTABLE-PATH is exe file which have same name your framework name in your root of framework.<br>
and replace realdevice exe file to we just made.<br>
<br>
Next, copy module file in simulator framework's root/Modules/*.swiftmodule folder.<br>
(likes x86_64.swiftdoc and x86_64.swiftmodule)<br>
and paste in real device framework's root/Modules/*.swiftmodule folder.<br>
<br>
Real device framework is now universal(fat) framework.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
***2. Archive(with bitcode) framework.<br>***
<br>
1) ***first, check option same for Universal(fat) framework and do this below task.<br>***
<br>
2) ***Build Settings -> User-Defined<br>***
Add **BITCODE_GENERATION_MODE** and set **bitcode**<br>
this option is the mark for do build with bitcode.<br>
<br>
3) Make sure build target **Generic iOS Device**.<br>
