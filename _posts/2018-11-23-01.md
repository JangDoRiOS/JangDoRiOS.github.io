Apple has changed their API, and removed the language code from the URL, so you should only the bundleId for the app you are looking for. For example:<br>
http://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=com.company.name<br>
In addition, you can add the country parameter to the query, to get results for a specific country App Store.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
http://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=com.company.name&country=kr<br>
The description, user rating and other fields might change between different App Store countries.
