First, you have to make  “YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h” file.<br><br>
when you add Objective-c file, XCode will ask you to make Bridging-Header file automatically.<br>
but if you added Bridging-Header file manually,<br>
you have to modify Objective-c Bridging Header in Swift Compiler - General in Build Settings in your project.<br>

In "YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h" file...
```swift
//
//  Use this file to import your target's public headers that you would like to expose to Swift.
//
#import "Your Objective-c class name.h"
```
Then just import your Objective-c class where you want to use in swift file.
