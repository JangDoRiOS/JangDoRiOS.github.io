You can manage your cocoaPods for each project in same workspace.

```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

use_frameworks!

workspace 'doriTest'

def common
pod 'RealmSwift'
end

target 'collectionView' do
xcodeproj 'project/collectionView/collectionView.xcodeproj'
common
end

target 'magnifyView' do
xcodeproj 'project/magnifyView/magnifyView.xcodeproj'
common
end
```

Now, you are a cocoaPods master :)
