You can manage your cocoaPods for each project in same workspace.<br />
and also even add child target in your project target like today extension.


```swift
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

use_frameworks!

workspace 'doriTest'

def common
    pod 'RealmSwift'
end

target 'textAttachment' do
    xcodeproj 'project/textAttachment/textAttachment.xcodeproj'
    common
end

target 'widget' do
    xcodeproj 'project/widget/widget.xcodeproj'
    common
    target 'today' do
    end
end


```


Now, you are a cocoaPods master :)
